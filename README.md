## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I used grid to center an object.

### Continued development

I wanted to add links to all buttons but realized I need JS to do that. It's not hard but I don't want to include JS in this project.
